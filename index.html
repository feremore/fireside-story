    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The wind howled through the trees; shutters smacking against the siding of the house...</p>
    <p>It was was lit!</p>
    <p> all the ghosties and gouls had shown up to the party fashonably late... like real OG spoopy lords</p>
    <p>the decor was spoopy af and was to be marveled by the party guests.</p>
